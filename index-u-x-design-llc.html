<p class="offset-top-30" style="text-align:justify;">"U. X. Design", also written as, "DBA U. X. Design", is fresh and innovative application of UX / UI / and Mutli-media design thinking. I specialize in what I call "digital experience design", also known as U X Design and U I Design (not C X Design, which is Customer Experience Design). What I do is still "fresh" today because the field of "user experience design" changes by nature. I have been doing this since before I picked up a glass of wine at a bar and before my first time ever getting drunk. I went out to drink after spending 120 hours spread out across seven days and my friends staged an intervention and took me drinking. I was too serious back then. These days, I'm only serious about my health and living my best life. Everything life has thrown at me I've been lucky to get  (if it's the good stuff) or lucky to dodge (if it's the bad stuff). When you get to my age you learn life is just luck. Dumb luck. If you do business with me, you'll know I'm a workaholic. If you don't, you probably will never know me. I'm not big on attention. It's been unlucky for me. Now to finish what I was building up to in the first three sentences: that my company is a Frontend Web Development company. Some truncate that to Frontend Development. I specialize in web-based work. So for me it is Frontend Web Development.<br /><br /><img src="maturity-rating-block.png" title="This maturity rating, TV-M, stands for Mature.

								<h8 class="text-white" style="font-size:90%;font-color:white;text-align:center;">Subscribed and paid monthly.<br />W2 Rate: $45.00 / hr. <span title="I offered this rate during a time of transition and I no longer accept W2 employment at this rate. I accept trade-work at this rate only from AMAZON COM SERVICES LLC because with it are training programs that reward company loyalty that will make up for the lower pay in an acceptalbe amount of time. No other employer is entitled to this rate. I will provide no further details regarding this. Back to why I accepted this rate originally: $28.54 was my Calendar Year 2000 rate for only six months of W2 employment, two probationary-periods, after which I was promoted to $45,000 a year, then $90,000 per year, after one more probationary period because I proved my value to my start-up company, Cofix, Inc. I did this by forging confidential metrics my bosses and I used to track my value and I was accurate about it so they provided a portion of the savings I earned back as pay according to our mutual agreement. We impressed oursleves and learned how brilliant we are together. I assisted them in selling their startup to recoup the pending losses their venture capitalist was facing due to failures within the startup that myself and my three next-level up bosses, including the President and my *lateral team-mates,* who called me their Team Lead, solved for the startup. We did it in approximately nine months and then they all took other jobs before the ship was about to sink because those details became confidential during the company to company sales process so they were given the blessing to seek other employment, I was too but I declined to do that and simply accepted lay-off because I knew I still had work to finish. I do not do two-things at once while on a critical path, hence, I had no time to explore other roles. I worked as many as 20 unbroken hours at a time and often worked until midnight. I was an evening person back then, and, today I am a morning or an evening person based on what project I choose and the time zone of the team I work with. Cofix, Inc. was the only job and team and bosses I have ever loved together as a professional triangle of productivity. Because it was impossilbe and we did the impossible, we all know each other's value. We bailed out of millions of dollars in mistakes in less than one calendar year, against all odds, even against the odds of that horrible day in September. We are what I call *START-UP COMMANDOS* and we know who we are. I will *not* provide further details *nor* will I provide additional names. If an employer hires any of us, independently or as team, they will be lucky to have us at six figures. It is a professional insult to offer any one of us less than six figures in 2025."><s>$28.54</s></span> / hr.<br />1099C DTC+C2C Rate: $65.00 / hr.<br />HOURLY Rate: $95 / 1 hr. at a time.<br />Frontend Web Development.<br />"Unsubscribe" / Cancel anytime by<br />clicking "Unsubscribe" belowüëá .<br /><br /></h8>

I have been making websites since 1997. I simply wanted to make a new, fancy name for it. So I registered this name. I learned that registering it made it seem like I have only been doing this since 2016 because only after registering this did my business name begin appearing in busines databases such as Dun and Bradstreet and Lexus Nexus for Business. I learned that the business name User Experience Design Limited was too many characters for most database entry fields so I shortened it to U. X. Desgin, recently, and to U X Design in short database fields so it is easier on data transfer interoperability processes that are handled by artificial intelligence now. Now I have to go back eveyrwhere my business ever did business (I am told) and change my business name to the shorter one or I will have tax issues. One cannot really understand how annoying this is for a business owner unless a person is in the same business as me and this has happened to them too. It simply puts a one-person business out of business during a business era like the U.S. Pandemic.">   I.   2016: BEFORE THE PANDEMIC</a>.<br /><a class="text-white" href="https://www.nvsilverflume.gov/" title="I got robbed (pickpocketed, cornered, pushed, and punched) repeatedly and local law enforcement only cared that whether I was the person they kept hearing was needing medication which is a drug dealer's fake call narrative to 911 when the drug dealer is about to forcibly overdose a target as a method of retaliation for noticing a drug deal. After the Las Vegas Strip spent millions to clean up the venues and casinos the air smelled fresh and clean for a few weeks and all of us who do not smoke, drink, or do drugs notifed. After that we started asking if the casinos would ban smoking and they said they cannot do that so after the smokers returned we all noticed the air turned smelly again and we gave the Las Vegas Strip a new nickname - The Stinky Strip - and laughed about as we found ways to leave while we still had our phones for those of us who still had one. Some got robbed and some got kidnapped and some got killed. The Las Vegas Strip is a stupid place to get drunk. It is wisely, by far, to drink soda, not water, unless you bring your own water in a sealed container to the bar, and they will let you do it, because water costs more than alcohol on the Las Vegas Strip. Drinking water and soda, or water and alcohol will lessen the effect of dehydration and make a drinker more likely to finish drinking without remaining drunk. Which means when they drive home they are not a danger to themselves or anyone else. The bars I did this in were impressed with me and said I could come in there anytime and do it again because it set a good example and one they have never seen done consistently in all their years in the business. The owner shook my hand, and smiled. Becuase doing that was more profitable for him (or her or them) that the regularly way, all told."> II. 2021: DURING THE PANDEMIC</a>.<br /><a id="no-filing-necessary" class="text-white" title="After renewing my business address, once the office reopened, and researching filing requirements in that tax jurisdiction, and going into the office in person, the office staff said I was never required to file anything for my service-only, web-based business, nor was I ever required to pay withholding taxes for sales because I am not a physical reseller, wholeseller and all the taxes I have paid for that are due for refund to me. They said not to file for register my business for businesses like this and to file for a refund of all of the overpaid taxes for all years overpaid, which is since I registered my business, in 2016. They said that will cover all of the years and will lead the State Department of Taxation and Assessments - SDAT - to find all of the overpayments and mail a check to return the uneeded funds to me." href="https://www.nvsilverflume.gov/">III. 2022: AFTER THE PANDEMIC</a>.<br /><a id="corrected-accounts-mistake" class="text-white" title="After a supposed best friend supposedly rescued me from Las Vegas during the zombie-land experience we now know as the U.S. Pandemic, my supposed friend left me stranded in a strange city with only a backpack, two jackets, no wallet, no money, no way to leave and nowhere to stay. I became homeless. I was homeless for an entire year, and slept on the side of a river for seven consecutive months and even worked at a warehouse after getting my wallet contents replaced while sleeping on said river-side. I think of myself as a pandemic-survivor now, inspite what my family and incompetent former roommates,  (and former bad-dates) enjoy saying about me in whenever and where-ever anyone will believe them." href="https://egov.maryland.gov/businessexpress/entitysearch">IV. 2023: "ZOMBIE-LAND"</a>.<br /><a id="corrected-accounts-mistake" class="text-white" title="After eight years in business (two years before registering this LLC) I finally found the problem - The Accountant filed my business under the wrong NAICS code (in 2018 two years, before the pandemic) causing taxes to be required for my Service-Only business. So I fired my accountant (four years ago, in 2020, the year of the U.S. pandemic, and have only this year, in 2024, recovered from the financial hardship caused by paying unnecessary taxes the last few tax seasons. I have just began addressing the Accountant's mistake with the IRS and local and State tax bodies to receive refunds for all those years and report his misfilings as his mistake in comprehending English as his 2nd (second) language." href="https://egov.maryland.gov/businessexpress/entitysearch">V. 2024: AFTER "ZOMBIE-LAND"</a>.</font></dd><br /><br />
